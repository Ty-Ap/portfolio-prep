## Abstractions and Aggrandizement

Just a local mountain cryptid making math do tricks. Student at Code Fellows

Prof Pitch: 
  variation of " Hi, I'm Ty. I'm an ex Lab tech, ex Radiologist with a puzzle obsession. I started getting into Software Development by watching a few youtube videos about Python, and messing around with code challenges as a way to de-stress on my lunch break and around the house. One day my partner asked what I was up to and I explained. After a few minutes of ribbing and laughing at my nerdiness, they asked why I don't just go to school for it since I gravitate towards it, and I didn't have a good answer.
  I quickly realized that my natural affinity for logic and language was imminently usable, and a far cry better than working in fast-health as it's called. 
  Ideally, I'd want to develop and test these skills in the game industry, but I'm open to anything as I just love to learn and build.
  My history in medicine and the Army give me a solid foundation in diverse team oriented projects, often with a high pressure time component, and also  working with only a vague goal .
  I believe these things separate me from my peers. "

What excites me most about tech, is that it's an industry of creation. Proof of work and creative spark given logical framework rule the industry, and that is such a start contrast from Army and Medical work.
